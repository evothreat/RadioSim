# Simple Radio Emulation

This project offers a basic emulation of a traditional radio system, implemented using Java. The design centers around recreating fundamental radio functions, allowing users to navigate frequencies, adjust volume, and observe signal disturbances.

## Key Features

- **Frequency Navigation**: Move to specific frequencies with ease.
- **Station Emulation**: Simulates radio stations with individual audio tracks.
- **Signal Interference**: As users deviate from a station's core frequency, the software introduces static interference, mimicking real-world radio behaviors.
- **Volume Management**: Adjust the audio output level as needed.
- **GUI**: A user-friendly interface with buttons and menus for easy interaction.
